Create registration view

-> create a serializer for the Django User model using Django REST Framework. It serializes/deserializes User instances to/from JSON representations.
     crearte a file serializer.py in app(api) folder
     code:---------------------------------------------------
     from django.contrib.auth.models import User  # Import the User model from Django's authentication system
     from rest_framework import serializers  # Import serializers from Django REST Framework

     class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):  # Define a serializer for the User model
        class Meta:  # Meta class to specify metadata options
          model = User  # Specify the User model for the serializer
          fields = ["id", "username" , "password"]  # Specify the fields to include in the serialized representation
          extra_kwargs = {"password": {"write_only": True}}  # Specify additional options for the password field
    
        def create(self, validated_data):  # Method to create a new user
        # Create a new user instance using the validated data
         user = User.objects.create_user(**validated_data)
          return user  # Return the newly created user instance



->create a Django view for creating user instances using Django REST Framework (DRF)
 update views.py
 code:-----------------------------------------------------------------------
from django.shortcuts import render  # Import render function from Django
from django.contrib.auth.models import User  # Import User model from Django's authentication system
from rest_framework import generics  # Import generics module from Django REST Framework
from.serializers import UserSerializer  # Import UserSerializer class from your serializers module
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated, AllowAny  # Import permission classes from Django REST Framework

     # Create your views here.

class CreateUserView(generics.CreateAPIView):  # Define a view for creating users
    queryset = User.objects.all()  # Specify the queryset to fetch all User objects
    serializer_class = UserSerializer  # Specify the serializer class to use for serializing/deserializing User objects
    permission_classes = [AllowAny]  # Specify the permission classes to determine who can access this view

-> connecting our Auth routes
   goto urls.py in backened and update
   # This Django URL configuration defines the URL patterns for your Django project. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

   code:-
         from django.contrib import admin  # Import the admin module
         from django.urls import path, include  # Import functions for defining URL patterns
         from api.views import CreateUserView  # Import the CreateUserView class for user registration
         from rest_framework_simplejwt.views import TokenObtainPairView, TokenRefreshView  # Import views for JWT token management

         # Define URL patterns
         urlpatterns = [
             path('admin/', admin.site.urls),  # Map the URL '/admin/' to the Django admin interface
             path("api/user/register/", CreateUserView.as_view(), name="register"),  # Map the URL '/api/user/register/' to the CreateUserView for user registration
             path("api/token/", TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name="get_token"),  # Map the URL '/api/token/' to the TokenObtainPairView for obtaining JWT tokens
             path("api/token/refresh/", TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name="refresh"),  # Map the URL '/api/token/refresh/' to the TokenRefreshView for refreshing JWT tokens
             path("api-auth/", include("rest_framework.urls")),  # Include the Django REST Framework's authentication URLs
         ]

-> Now in terminal( cd to backened)
The makemigrations cmd is used to generate new migration files based on changes you have made to your models. These migration files define the operations that need to be applied to the database schema to make it match the changes you've made to your models.
-------python manage.py makemigrations
--------python manage.py migrate

---------python manage.py runserver

 Now go to route ---/api/user/register/
       ->create new user
       -> now goto  ---/api/token/ 
              ->generate access and refresh token by entering the user credential


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now create custom models
 goto models.py in api folder and work there

 code:
        from django.db import models
        from django.contrib.auth.models import User
       
       # This class defines the structure of the Note objects in the database.
        class Note(models.Model):
            # A short text field limited to 100 characters for the note's title.
            title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
            
            # A large text field for the note's content. No maximum length is enforced.
            content = models.TextField()
            
            # A date and time field that automatically sets to the note's creation time.
            created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
            
            # A reference to the User model, establishing a many-to-one relationship.
            # Each note is linked to a single user, but a user can have many notes.
            # The on_delete=models.CASCADE argument ensures that when a user is deleted,
            # all their notes are also deleted from the database.
            # The related_name="notes" allows access to a user's notes by calling user.notes.all(),
            # providing a straightforward way to retrieve all notes by a particular user.
            author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="notes")
          
            # This method returns the note's title when its object is called,
            # making it easier to identify the note instance, especially in the Django admin interface.
            def __str__(self):
                return self.title
        

Now create a serializer for this model 
   A serializer will allow you to easily convert Note instances into JSON format for API responses and vice-versa, from JSON to Note instances for creating or updating notes via your API.
   ->update serializer.py

          # Import the serializers module from Django Rest Framework
           from rest_framework import serializers
           # Import the Note model from the models.py file in the same directory
           from .models import Note
           
           # Define a class NoteSerializer that inherits from serializers.ModelSerializer
           # This class will be responsible for converting Note instances into JSON format and vice-versa
           class NoteSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
               # Meta class is used to provide metadata to the NoteSerializer class
               class Meta:
                   # Specify the model associated with this serializer
                   model = Note
                   # Define the fields that should be included in the serialized output
                   # This allows you to be explicit about what data should be made available over your API
                   fields = ['id', 'title', 'content', 'created_at', 'author']
                   # Specify fields that should be read-only
                   # read_only_fields are included in the serialized output but are not expected or modified in the input
                   # 'author' is set to read-only to prevent it from being modified through the API directly
                   # This is common for fields that are automatically populated by the model or by the logic in your views
                   read_only_fields = ('author', 'created_at',)
